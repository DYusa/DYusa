### Hi there 👋

    🎓 I have 4 (almost) degrees, on anthropology, psychology, information systems, and data science so I can fight the renaissance spirits.
    🔭 I’m currently working on developing my career.
    🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced parts of NLP applications with my Internship
    👯 I’m looking to collaborate on learning opportunities.
    🤔 I’m looking for help with any of above.
    💬 Ask me about why I have almost four degrees.
